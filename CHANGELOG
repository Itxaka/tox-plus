2.1.1
----------

- fix platform skipping for detox

- report skipped platforms as skips in the summary

2.1.0
----------

- fix issue258, fix issue248, fix issue253: for non-test commands 
  (installation, venv creation) we pass in the full invocation environment.

- remove experimental --set-home option which was hardly used and
  hackily implemented (if people want home-directory isolation we should
  figure out a better way to do it, possibly through a plugin)

- fix issue259: passenv is now a line-list which allows to intersperse
  comments.  Thanks stefano-m.

- allow envlist to be a multi-line list, to intersperse comments
  and have long envlist settings split more naturally.  Thanks Andre Caron.

- introduce a TOX_TESTENV_PASSENV setting which is honored
  when constructing the set of environment variables for test environments.
  Thanks Marc Abramowitz for pushing in this direction.


2.0.2
----------

- fix issue247: tox now passes the LANG variable from the tox invocation 
  environment to the test environment by default.

- add SYSTEMDRIVE into default passenv on windows to allow pip6 to work.
  Thanks Michael Krause.


2.0.1
-----------

- fix wheel packaging to properly require argparse on py26.

2.0.0
-----------

- (new) introduce environment variable isolation:
  tox now only passes the PATH and PIP_INDEX_URL variable from the tox
  invocation environment to the test environment and on Windows 
  also ``SYSTEMROOT``, ``PATHEXT``, ``TEMP`` and ``TMP`` whereas
  on unix additionally ``TMPDIR`` is passed.  If you need to pass 
  through further environment variables you can use the new ``passenv`` setting,
  a space-separated list of environment variable names.  Each name
  can make use of fnmatch-style glob patterns.  All environment
  variables which exist in the tox-invocation environment will be copied
  to the test environment.

- a new ``--help-ini`` option shows all possible testenv settings and
  their defaults.

- (new) introduce a way to specify on which platform a testenvironment is to
  execute: the new per-venv "platform" setting allows to specify 
  a regular expression which is matched against sys.platform.
  If platform is set and doesn't match the platform spec in the test 
  environment the test environment is ignored, no setup or tests are attempted.

- (new) add per-venv "ignore_errors" setting, which defaults to False.
   If ``True``, a non-zero exit code from one command will be ignored and
   further commands will be executed (which was the default behavior in tox <
   2.0).  If ``False`` (the default), then a non-zero exit code from one command
   will abort execution of commands for that environment.

- show and store in json the version dependency information for each venv

- remove the long-deprecated "distribute" option as it has no effect these days.

- fix issue233: avoid hanging with tox-setuptools integration example. Thanks simonb.

- fix issue120: allow substitution for the commands section.  Thanks
  Volodymyr Vitvitski.

- fix issue235: fix AttributeError with --installpkg.  Thanks
  Volodymyr Vitvitski.

- tox has now somewhat pep8 clean code, thanks to Volodymyr Vitvitski.

- fix issue240: allow to specify empty argument list without it being
  rewritten to ".".  Thanks Daniel Hahler.

- introduce experimental (not much documented yet) plugin system
  based on pytest's externalized "pluggy" system.
  See tox/hookspecs.py for the current hooks.

- introduce parser.add_testenv_attribute() to register an ini-variable
  for testenv sections.  Can be used from plugins through the 
  tox_add_option hook.

- rename internal files -- tox offers no external API except for the
  experimental plugin hooks, use tox internals at your own risk.

- DEPRECATE distshare in documentation



1.9.2
-----------

- backout ability that --force-deps substitutes name/versions in
  requirement files due to various issues.
  This fixes issue228, fixes issue230, fixes issue231
  which popped up with 1.9.1.

1.9.1
-----------

- use a file instead of a pipe for command output in "--result-json".
  Fixes some termination issues with python2.6.

- allow --force-deps to override dependencies in "-r" requirements
  files.  Thanks Sontek for the PR.

- fix issue227: use "-m virtualenv" instead of "-mvirtualenv" to make
  it work with pyrun.  Thanks Marc-Andre Lemburg.


1.9.0
-----------

- fix issue193: Remove ``--pre`` from the default ``install_command``; by
  default tox will now only install final releases from PyPI for unpinned
  dependencies. Use ``pip_pre = true`` in a testenv or the ``--pre``
  command-line option to restore the previous behavior.

- fix issue199: fill resultlog structure ahead of virtualenv creation 

- refine determination if we run from Jenkins, thanks Borge Lanes.

- echo output to stdout when ``--report-json`` is used

- fix issue11: add a ``skip_install`` per-testenv setting which
  prevents the installation of a package. Thanks Julian Krause.

- fix issue124: ignore command exit codes; when a command has a "-" prefix,
  tox will ignore the exit code of that command

- fix issue198: fix broken envlist settings, e.g. {py26,py27}{-lint,}

- fix issue191: lessen factor-use checks


1.8.1
-----------

- fix issue190: allow setenv to be empty.

- allow escaping curly braces with "\".  Thanks Marc Abramowitz for the PR.

- allow "." names in environment names such that "py27-django1.7" is a
  valid environment name.  Thanks Alex Gaynor and Alex Schepanovski.

- report subprocess exit code when execution fails.  Thanks Marius
  Gedminas.

1.8.0
-----------

- new multi-dimensional configuration support.  Many thanks to
  Alexander Schepanovski for the complete PR with docs.
  And to Mike Bayer and others for testing and feedback.

- fix issue148: remove "__PYVENV_LAUNCHER__" from os.environ when starting
  subprocesses. Thanks Steven Myint.

- fix issue152: set VIRTUAL_ENV when running test commands,
  thanks Florian Ludwig.

- better report if we can't get version_info from an interpreter
  executable. Thanks Floris Bruynooghe.


1.7.2
-----------

- fix issue150: parse {posargs} more like we used to do it pre 1.7.0.
  The 1.7.0 behaviour broke a lot of OpenStack projects.
  See PR85 and the issue discussions for (far) more details, hopefully
  resulting in a more refined behaviour in the 1.8 series.
  And thanks to Clark Boylan for the PR.

- fix issue59: add a config variable ``skip-missing-interpreters`` as well as
  command line option ``--skip-missing-interpreters`` which won't fail the
  build if Python interpreters listed in tox.ini are missing.  Thanks 
  Alexandre Conrad for PR104.

- fix issue164: better traceback info in case of failing test commands.
  Thanks Marc Abramowitz for PR92.

- support optional env variable substitution, thanks Morgan Fainberg
  for PR86.

- limit python hashseed to 1024 on Windows to prevent possible
  memory errors.  Thanks March Schlaich for the PR90.

1.7.1
---------

- fix issue162: don't list python 2.5 as compatibiliy/supported

- fix issue158 and fix issue155: windows/virtualenv properly works now:
  call virtualenv through "python -m virtualenv" with the same 
  interpreter which invoked tox.  Thanks Chris Withers, Ionel Maries Cristian.

1.7.0
---------

- don't lookup "pip-script" anymore but rather just "pip" on windows 
  as this is a pip implementation detail and changed with pip-1.5.  
  It might mean that tox-1.7 is not able to install a different pip 
  version into a virtualenv anymore.

- drop Python2.5 compatibility because it became too hard due
  to the setuptools-2.0 dropping support.  tox now has no 
  support for creating python2.5 based environments anymore
  and all internal special-handling has been removed.

- merged PR81: new option --force-dep which allows to 
  override tox.ini specified dependencies in setuptools-style.
  For example "--force-dep 'django<1.6'" will make sure
  that any environment using "django" as a dependency will 
  get the latest 1.5 release.  Thanks Bruno Oliveria for 
  the complete PR.
  
- merged PR125: tox now sets "PYTHONHASHSEED" to a random value
  and offers a "--hashseed" option to repeat a test run with a specific seed.
  You can also use --hashsheed=noset to instruct tox to leave the value
  alone.  Thanks Chris Jerdonek for all the work behind this.

- fix issue132: removing zip_safe setting (so it defaults to false)
  to allow installation of tox
  via easy_install/eggs.  Thanks Jenisys.

- fix issue126: depend on virtualenv>=1.11.2 so that we can rely
  (hopefully) on a pip version which supports --pre. (tox by default
  uses to --pre).  also merged in PR84 so that we now call "virtualenv"
  directly instead of looking up interpreters.  Thanks Ionel Maries Cristian.
  This also fixes issue140.

- fix issue130: you can now set install_command=easy_install {opts} {packages}
  and expect it to work for repeated tox runs (previously it only worked
  when always recreating).  Thanks jenisys for precise reporting. 

- fix issue129: tox now uses Popen(..., universal_newlines=True) to force 
  creation of unicode stdout/stderr streams.  fixes a problem on specific
  platform configs when creating virtualenvs with Python3.3. Thanks
  Jorgen Sch√§fer or investigation and solution sketch.

- fix issue128: enable full substitution in install_command,
  thanks for the PR to Ronald Evers

- rework and simplify "commands" parsing and in particular posargs
  substitutions to avoid various win32/posix related quoting issues.

- make sure that the --installpkg option trumps any usedevelop settings
  in tox.ini or

- introduce --no-network to tox's own test suite to skip tests
  requiring networks

- introduce --sitepackages to force sitepackages=True in all
  environments.   

- fix issue105 -- don't depend on an existing HOME directory from tox tests.

1.6.1
-----

- fix issue119: {envsitepackagesdir} is now correctly computed and has
  a better test to prevent regression.

- fix issue116: make 1.6 introduced behaviour of changing to a 
  per-env HOME directory during install activities dependent 
  on "--set-home" for now.  Should re-establish the old behaviour
  when no option is given.

- fix issue118: correctly have two tests use realpath(). Thanks Barry
  Warsaw.

- fix test runs on environments without a home directory
  (in this case we use toxinidir as the homedir)

- fix issue117: python2.5 fix: don't use ``--insecure`` option because 
  its very existence depends on presence of "ssl".  If you
  want to support python2.5/pip1.3.1 based test environments you need 
  to install ssl and/or use PIP_INSECURE=1 through ``setenv``. section.

- fix issue102: change to {toxinidir} when installing dependencies.
  this allows to use relative path like in "-rrequirements.txt".

1.6.0
-----------------

- fix issue35: add new EXPERIMENTAL "install_command" testenv-option to
  configure the installation command with options for dep/pkg install.
  Thanks Carl Meyer for the PR and docs.

- fix issue91: python2.5 support by vendoring the virtualenv-1.9.1 
  script and forcing pip<1.4. Also the default [py25] environment 
  modifies the default installer_command (new config option)
  to use pip without the "--pre" option which was introduced 
  with pip-1.4 and is now required if you want to install non-stable 
  releases.  (tox defaults to install with "--pre" everywhere).

- during installation of dependencies HOME is now set to a pseudo
  location ({envtmpdir}/pseudo-home).  If an index url was specified
  a .pydistutils.cfg file will be written with an index_url setting
  so that packages defining ``setup_requires`` dependencies will not
  silently use your HOME-directory settings or https://pypi.python.org.

- fix issue1: empty setup files are properly detected, thanks Anthon van
  der Neuth

- remove toxbootstrap.py for now because it is broken.

- fix issue109 and fix issue111: multiple "-e" options are now combined
  (previously the last one would win). Thanks Anthon van der Neut.

- add --result-json option to write out detailed per-venv information
  into a json report file to be used by upstream tools.

- add new config options ``usedevelop`` and ``skipsdist`` as well as a
  command line option ``--develop`` to install the package-under-test in develop mode.
  thanks Monty Tailor for the PR.

- always unset PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTE because newer setuptools doesn't like it

- if a HOMEDIR cannot be determined, use the toxinidir.

- refactor interpreter information detection to live in new
  tox/interpreters.py file, tests in tests/test_interpreters.py.

1.5.0
-----------------

- fix issue104: use setuptools by default, instead of distribute,
  now that setuptools has distribute merged.

- make sure test commands are searched first in the virtualenv 

- re-fix issue2 - add whitelist_externals to be used in ``[testenv*]``
  sections, allowing to avoid warnings for commands such as ``make``,
  used from the commands value.

- fix issue97 - allow substitutions to reference from other sections
  (thanks Krisztian Fekete)

- fix issue92 - fix {envsitepackagesdir} to actually work again

- show (test) command that is being executed, thanks 
  Lukasz Balcerzak

- re-license tox to MIT license

- depend on virtualenv-1.9.1 

- rename README.txt to README.rst to make bitbucket happier


1.4.3
-----------------

- use pip-script.py instead of pip.exe on win32 to avoid the lock exe
  file on execution issue (thanks Philip Thiem)

- introduce -l|--listenv option to list configured environments
  (thanks  Lukasz Balcerzak)

- fix downloadcache determination to work according to docs: Only
  make pip use a download cache if PIP_DOWNLOAD_CACHE or a 
  downloadcache=PATH testenv setting is present. (The ENV setting
  takes precedence)

- fix issue84 - pypy on windows creates a bin not a scripts venv directory
  (thanks Lukasz Balcerzak)

- experimentally introduce --installpkg=PATH option to install a package
  rather than create/install an sdist package.  This will still require
  and use tox.ini and tests from the current working dir (and not from the
  remote package).

- substitute {envsitepackagesdir} with the package installation
  directory (closes #72) (thanks g2p)

- issue #70 remove PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE workaround now that
  virtualenv behaves properly (thanks g2p)

- merged tox-quickstart command, contributed by Marc Abramowitz, which
  generates a default tox.ini after asking a few questions

- fix #48 - win32 detection of pypy and other interpreters that are on PATH
  (thanks Gustavo Picon)

- fix grouping of index servers, it is now done by name instead of 
  indexserver url, allowing to use it to separate dependencies
  into groups even if using the same default indexserver.

- look for "tox.ini" files in parent dirs of current dir (closes #34)

- the "py" environment now by default uses the current interpreter
  (sys.executable) make tox' own setup.py test execute tests with it
  (closes #46)

- change tests to not rely on os.path.expanduser (closes #60),
  also make mock session return args[1:] for more precise checking (closes #61)
  thanks to Barry Warsaw for both.

1.4.2
-----------------

- fix some tests which fail if /tmp is a symlink to some other place
- "python setup.py test" now runs tox tests via tox :)
  also added an example on how to do it for your project.

1.4.1
-----------------

- fix issue41 better quoting on windows - you can now use "<" and ">" in
  deps specifications, thanks Chris Withers for reporting

1.4
-----------------

- fix issue26 - no warnings on absolute or relative specified paths for commands
- fix issue33 - commentchars are ignored in key-value settings allowing
  for specifying commands like: python -c "import sys ; print sys"
  which would formerly raise irritating errors because the ";"
  was considered a comment
- tweak and improve reporting
- refactor reporting and virtualenv manipulation 
  to be more accessible from 3rd party tools
- support value substitution from other sections
  with the {[section]key} syntax
- fix issue29 - correctly point to pytest explanation
  for importing modules fully qualified
- fix issue32 - use --system-site-packages and don't pass --no-site-packages
- add python3.3 to the default env list, so early adopters can test
- drop python2.4 support (you can still have your tests run on
- fix the links/checkout howtos in the docs
  python-2.4, just tox itself requires 2.5 or higher.

1.3
-----------------

- fix: allow to specify wildcard filesystem paths when 
  specifying dependencies such that tox searches for 
  the highest version

- fix issue issue21: clear PIP_REQUIRES_VIRTUALENV which avoids
  pip installing to the wrong environment, thanks to bb's streeter

- make the install step honour a testenv's setenv setting
  (thanks Ralf Schmitt)


1.2
-----------------

- remove the virtualenv.py that was distributed with tox and depend
  on >=virtualenv-1.6.4 (possible now since the latter fixes a few bugs
  that the inlining tried to work around)
- fix issue10: work around UnicodeDecodeError when invoking pip (thanks
  Marc Abramowitz)
- fix a problem with parsing {posargs} in tox commands (spotted by goodwill)
- fix the warning check for commands to be installed in testenvironment
  (thanks Michael Foord for reporting)

1.1
-----------------

- fix issue5 - don't require argparse for python versions that have it
- fix issue6 - recreate virtualenv if installing dependencies failed
- fix issue3 - fix example on frontpage
- fix issue2 - warn if a test command does not come from the test
  environment
- fixed/enhanced: except for initial install always call "-U
  --no-deps" for installing the sdist package to ensure that a package
  gets upgraded even if its version number did not change. (reported on
  TIP mailing list and IRC)
- inline virtualenv.py (1.6.1) script to avoid a number of issues,
  particularly failing to install python3 environments from a python2
  virtualenv installation.
- rework and enhance docs for display on readthedocs.org

1.0
-----------------

- move repository and toxbootstrap links to http://bitbucket.org/hpk42/tox
- fix issue7: introduce a "minversion" directive such that tox
  bails out if it does not have the correct version.
- fix issue24: introduce a way to set environment variables for
  for test commands (thanks Chris Rose)
- fix issue22: require virtualenv-1.6.1, obsoleting virtualenv5 (thanks Jannis Leidel)
  and making things work with pypy-1.5 and python3 more seamlessly
- toxbootstrap.py (used by jenkins build slaves) now follows the latest release of virtualenv
- fix issue20: document format of URLs for specifying dependencies
- fix issue19: substitute Hudson for Jenkins everywhere following the renaming
  of the project.  NOTE: if you used the special [tox:hudson]
  section it will now need to be named [tox:jenkins].
- fix issue 23 / apply some ReST fixes
- change the positional argument specifier to use {posargs:} syntax and
  fix issues #15 and #10 by refining the argument parsing method (Chris Rose)
- remove use of inipkg lazy importing logic -
  the namespace/imports are anyway very small with tox.
- fix a fspath related assertion to work with debian installs which uses
  symlinks
- show path of the underlying virtualenv invocation and bootstrap
  virtualenv.py into a working subdir
- added a CONTRIBUTORS file

0.9
-----------------

- fix pip-installation mixups by always unsetting PIP_RESPECT_VIRTUALENV
  (thanks Armin Ronacher)
- issue1: Add a toxbootstrap.py script for tox, thanks to Sridhar
  Ratnakumar
- added support for working with different and multiple PyPI indexservers.
- new option: -r|--recreate to force recreation of virtualenv
- depend on py>=1.4.0 which does not contain or install the py.test
  anymore which is now a separate distribution "pytest".
- show logfile content if there is an error (makes CI output
  more readable)

0.8
-----------------

- work around a virtualenv limitation which crashes if
  PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE is set.
- run pip/easy installs from the environment log directory, avoids
  naming clashes between env names and dependencies (thanks ronny)
- require a more recent version of py lib
- refactor and refine config detection to work from a single file
  and to detect the case where a python installation overwrote
  an old one and resulted in a new executable. This invalidates
  the existing virtualenvironment now.
- change all internal source to strip trailing whitespaces

0.7
-----------------

- use virtualenv5 (my own fork of virtualenv3) for now to create python3
  environments, fixes a couple of issues and makes tox more likely to
  work with Python3 (on non-windows environments)

- add ``sitepackages`` option for testenv sections so that environments
  can be created with access to globals (default is not to have access,
  i.e. create environments with ``--no-site-packages``.

- addressing issue4: always prepend venv-path to PATH variable when calling subprocesses

- fix issue2: exit with proper non-zero return code if there were
  errors or test failures.

- added unittest2 examples contributed by Michael Foord

- only allow 'True' or 'False' for boolean config values
  (lowercase / uppercase is irrelevant)

- recreate virtualenv on changed configurations

0.6
-----------------

- fix OSX related bugs that could cause the caller's environment to get
  screwed (sorry).  tox was using the same file as virtualenv for tracking
  the Python executable dependency and there also was confusion wrt links.
  this should be fixed now.

- fix long description, thanks Michael Foord

0.5
-----------------

- initial release
