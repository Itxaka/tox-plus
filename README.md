What is Tox-plus?
--------------------
Tox-plus is a fork of tox done in order to add more features to it.

![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Itxaka/tox-plus.svg?branch=master)


Differences
-------------

 - The ``{env:key:default}`` substitution for commands now works
 - Added 2 extra hooks for plugins, ``pretest`` and ``posttest`` executed before and after the tests are run, for easy and useful plugin development

What is Tox?
--------------------

Tox is a generic virtualenv management and test command line tool you can use for:

* checking your package installs correctly with different Python versions and
  interpreters

* running your tests in each of the environments, configuring your test tool of choice

* acting as a frontend to Continuous Integration servers, greatly
  reducing boilerplate and merging CI and shell-based testing.
